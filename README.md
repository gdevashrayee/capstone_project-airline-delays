# capstone_project-airline-delays
## Project Overview
In the present world the major components of a transportation system include a passenger airline. With time, we have evolved and improved the airline transportation system and operations. However, even in today's day and time, flight delays cause a lot of inconvinienece to our modern passengers. Every year approximately 25-30% of flights are delayed, costing passengers and the operations approximately more than $28 billion in money and their time.

## Purpose//Problem Statement
The purpose of this project is to predict whether a given flight will be delayed, given the information of the scheduled departure.
1. Which airline has the most delayed flights?
2. Which routes have the most delayed occurrences?
3. Will flying time impact delay occurrences?
4. Which day of the week will have the most delay? Weekend vs Weekday
5. Which airport (departure/arrival) is the worst?

By conducting an analysis of flight times and metrics regarding airlines, day of travel, and airport arrivals/ departures we can predict what flights are more likely to experience delays. Once patterns are identified, solutions can be developed to address the issues.

## Proposal of machine learning model
Supervised Learning- Logistic Regression- binary result Delayed/Not delayed

#### What variables will be used for the machine learning model?

  y= "Dep_Del15"

  X= other columns (Carrier and Airport columns need to be converted to numerical data)

    1) Create a model with LogisticRegression().
    2) Train the model with model.fit().
    3) Make predictions with model.predict().
    4) Validate the model with accuracy_score().
